# kv - Kernel View

[![Rust 2024](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust_2024-≥1.85-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2024/)

A tiny, dependency-free system inspector for Linux.

Born from the frustration of SSHing into an embedded board and realizing
that lspci, lsusb, and all the rest of most essential info-oriented tools
are nowhere to be found. kv is a single static binary that tells you what
hardware you've got, reading directly from /sys and /proc like nature
intended.

## Installation

Pre-built static binaries are available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vak-leon/kv/releases/latest).

### Download for your architecture:

**With curl:**

```bash
# x86_64 (most Linux servers and desktops)
curl -Lo kv https://github.com/vak-leon/kv/releases/latest/download/kv-x64 && chmod +x kv

# ARM64 (Raspberry Pi 4/5, Jetson, Apple Silicon VMs)
curl -Lo kv https://github.com/vak-leon/kv/releases/latest/download/kv-arm64 && chmod +x kv
```

**With wget:**

```bash
# x86_64
wget -O kv https://github.com/vak-leon/kv/releases/latest/download/kv-x64 && chmod +x kv

# ARM64
wget -O kv https://github.com/vak-leon/kv/releases/latest/download/kv-arm64 && chmod +x kv
```

**Other architectures:**
Use `kv-x86` (32-bit PC), `kv-arm` (32-bit ARM), `kv-riscv64` (64-bit RISC-V), or `kv-ppc` (PowerPC).

**Copy to an embedded board:**

```bash
scp kv user@board:/tmp/kv
ssh user@board /tmp/kv snapshot -jp
```

> [!NOTE]
> If using a Windows machine to copy the file to the target, `chmod` it on the target to make it runnable.

## Usage

```bash
kv pci          # PCI devices
kv usb          # USB devices
kv block        # Disks and partitions
kv net          # Network interfaces
kv cpu          # CPU info
kv mem          # Memory stats
kv mounts       # Mount points
kv thermal      # Temperature sensors
kv power        # Power supplies / batteries
kv dt           # Device tree (ARM/RISC-V)
kv snapshot     # Everything as JSON
```

### Output Formats

```bash
kv mem          # Text: KEY=VALUE pairs
kv mem -j       # JSON
kv mem -jp      # Pretty JSON
kv mem -v       # Verbose (more fields)
kv mem -h       # Human-readable sizes (16G not 16324656)
kv mem -jpvh    # Combine flags
```

### Filtering

```bash
kv block -f nvme       # Only NVMe devices
kv pci -f nvidia       # Only NVIDIA PCI devices
kv dt -f gpu           # Device tree nodes matching "gpu"
kv net -jv -f eth      # Combine with other flags (keep -f last)
```

Note: `-f` takes an argument, so keep it separate from combined flags (use `-jv -f pattern`, not `-jvf pattern`).

## Building from Source

Requires Rust 1.85+ (uses Rust 2024 edition).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full cross-compilation setup.

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build (static, recommended)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

### Cross-Compilation

Cargo aliases for embedded targets:

```bash
cargo x86_64   # x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo x86      # i686-unknown-linux-musl (32-bit)
cargo arm64    # aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo aarch64  # same as arm64
cargo arm      # arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf (32-bit ARM)
cargo riscv64  # riscv64gc-unknown-linux-musl
cargo ppc      # powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu (big-endian)
```

ARM, RISC-V, and PowerPC builds automatically include the `dt` (device tree) feature.

Prerequisites (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

### Minimal Builds

Don't need USB? Don't compile it:

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features "mem,cpu,block"
```

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| pci | PCI device enumeration |
| usb | USB device enumeration |
| block | Block devices and partitions |
| net | Network interfaces, IPs, wireless signal |

| mem | Memory information |
| mounts | Mount points |
| thermal | Temperature sensors and cooling devices |
| power | Power supplies and batteries |
| dt | Device tree (ARM/RISC-V) |

## Example Output

```bash
$ kv mem -h

```

## Design Philosophy

- **No dependencies.** Zero external crates. std only.
- **Single static binary.** Copy it anywhere, it just works.
- **Read-only.** We observe, we don't touch.
- **Graceful degradation.** Missing /sys/bus/pci? We say so and move on.
- **Stable output.** Scripts can depend on the format.

## Contributing

## Supported Architectures

| Target | Alias | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| x86_64-unknown-linux-musl | `cargo x86_64` | 64-bit x86 |
| i686-unknown-linux-musl | `cargo x86` | 32-bit x86 |
| aarch64-unknown-linux-musl | `cargo arm64` / `cargo aarch64` | 64-bit ARM |
| arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf | `cargo arm` | 32-bit ARM, hard float |
| riscv64gc-unknown-linux-musl | `cargo riscv64` | 64-bit RISC-V |
| powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu | `cargo ppc` | 32-bit PowerPC (big-endian)* |

*PowerPC uses GNU libc instead of musl because `powerpc-unknown-linux-musl` isn't available
in stable Rust. The binary is still fully static but larger (~1.2 MB vs ~550 KB for musl targets).

## Security

kv is designed for untrusted environments. See the security table below.

| Protection | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| Memory safety | Rust's type system prevents buffer overflows, use-after-free |
| JSON escaping | Control chars, quotes, backslashes properly escaped |
| Path traversal | Rejects `..` in devicetree paths |
| Input limits | Filter patterns truncated to 1024 chars |
| Recursion limits | Devicetree traversal stops at 64 levels |
| Safe parsing | Returns `None` on overflow instead of panicking |
| Read-only | Only reads from /sys and /proc, never writes |
| No shell | No command execution, no injection surface |
| No network | Pure local filesystem operations |
