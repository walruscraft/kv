# kv - Kernel View

[![Rust 2024](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust_2024-≥1.85-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2024/)

A tiny, dependency-free system inspector for Linux.

Born from the frustration of SSHing into an embedded board and realizing
that lspci, lsusb, and all the rest of most essential info-oriented tools
are nowhere to be found. kv is a single static binary that tells you what
hardware you've got, reading directly from /sys and /proc like nature
intended.

## Installation

Pre-built static binaries are available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/walruscraft/kv/releases/latest).

### Download, Verify, Install

Each release includes SHA256 checksums for verification.

**x86_64** (most Linux servers and desktops):

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/walruscraft/kv/releases/latest/download/kv-x86_64
curl -LO https://github.com/walruscraft/kv/releases/latest/download/kv-x86_64.sha256
sha256sum -c kv-x86_64.sha256
mv kv-x86_64 kv && chmod +x kv
./kv --version
```

**ARM64** (Raspberry Pi 4/5, Jetson, Apple Silicon VMs):

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/walruscraft/kv/releases/latest/download/kv-arm64
curl -LO https://github.com/walruscraft/kv/releases/latest/download/kv-arm64.sha256
sha256sum -c kv-arm64.sha256
mv kv-arm64 kv && chmod +x kv
./kv --version
```

**Other architectures:**
Use `kv-x86` (32-bit PC), `kv-arm` (32-bit ARM), `kv-riscv64` (64-bit RISC-V),
`kv-ppc64le` (PowerPC64 LE), or `kv-mipsel` (MIPS LE).
Each has corresponding `.sha256`, `.sig`, and `.crt` files.

### Verify Signatures (optional)

Releases are signed with [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) keyless signing via GitHub Actions OIDC.
This proves the binary was built by the official release workflow, not a compromised maintainer machine.

```bash
# Install cosign (https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/)
# Then verify:
cosign verify-blob kv-x86_64 \
  --signature kv-x86_64.sig \
  --certificate kv-x86_64.crt \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github.com/walruscraft/kv/\.github/workflows/release\.yml@refs/tags/v.*'
```

**Quick install (skip verification):**

```bash
curl -Lo kv https://github.com/walruscraft/kv/releases/latest/download/kv-x86_64 && chmod +x kv
```

**Copy to an embedded board:**

```bash
scp kv-arm64 user@board:/tmp/kv
ssh user@board chmod +x /tmp/kv
ssh user@board /tmp/kv snapshot -jp
```

> [!NOTE]
> If using a Windows machine to copy the file to the target, `chmod` it on the target to make it runnable.

## Usage

```bash
kv pci          # PCI devices
kv usb          # USB devices
kv block        # Disks and partitions
kv net          # Network interfaces
kv cpu          # CPU info
kv mem          # Memory stats
kv mounts       # Mount points
kv thermal      # Temperature sensors
kv power        # Power supplies / batteries
kv dt           # Device tree (ARM/RISC-V)
kv snapshot     # Everything as JSON
```

### Output Formats

```bash
kv mem          # Text: KEY=VALUE pairs
kv mem -j       # JSON
kv mem -jp      # Pretty JSON
kv mem -v       # Verbose (more fields)
kv mem -h       # Human-readable sizes (16G not 16324656)
kv mem -jpvh    # Combine flags
```

### Filtering

```bash
kv block -f nvme       # Only NVMe devices
kv pci -f nvidia       # Only NVIDIA PCI devices
kv dt -f gpu           # Device tree nodes matching "gpu"
kv net -jv -f eth      # Combine with other flags (keep -f last)
```

Note: `-f` takes an argument, so keep it separate from combined flags (use `-jv -f pattern`, not `-jvf pattern`).

## Building from Source

Requires **Rust nightly** (uses build-std for no_std) and Rust 2024 edition.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full cross-compilation setup.

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build (static, ~113 KB stripped)
cargo build --release
```

### Cross-Compilation

Cargo aliases for embedded targets (all use gnu targets with build-std):

```bash
cargo x86_64   # x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
cargo x86      # i686-unknown-linux-gnu (32-bit)
cargo arm64    # aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
cargo aarch64  # same as arm64
cargo arm      # arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf (32-bit ARM)
cargo riscv64  # riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu
cargo ppc64    # powerpc64le-unknown-linux-gnu
cargo mips     # mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu
```

ARM, RISC-V, PowerPC64, and MIPS builds automatically include the `dt` (device tree) feature.

Prerequisites (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
# Nightly toolchain required for build-std
rustup default nightly

# Cross-compiler for ARM64
sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

### Minimal Builds

Don't need USB? Don't compile it:

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features "mem,cpu,block"
```

## Design Philosophy

- **Minimal dependencies.** no_std with direct syscalls, no libc. Just 3 crates: origin (startup), rustix (syscalls), itoa (number formatting). Zero heap allocation.
- **Single static binary.** ~113 KB stripped, copy it anywhere, it just works.
- **Read-only.** We observe, we don't touch.
- **Graceful degradation.** Missing /sys/bus/pci? We say so and move on.
- **Stable output.** Scripts can depend on the format.

## Supported Architectures

| Target | Alias | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu | `cargo x86_64` | 64-bit x86 |
| i686-unknown-linux-gnu | `cargo x86` | 32-bit x86 |
| aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu | `cargo arm64` / `cargo aarch64` | 64-bit ARM |
| arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf | `cargo arm` | 32-bit ARM, hard float |
| riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu | `cargo riscv64` | 64-bit RISC-V |
| powerpc64le-unknown-linux-gnu | `cargo ppc64` | 64-bit PowerPC (LE) |
| mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu | `cargo mips` | 32-bit MIPS (LE) |

All targets produce static binaries (~113 KB stripped) using no_std with build-std. Zero heap allocation.

> **Note on big-endian PPC64/MIPS:** Big-endian variants are blocked upstream
> by rustix (which has no linux_raw backend for these ABIs). Only little-endian
> targets are supported. This may change when rustix adds BE support.

### Known QEMU issues

QEMU user-mode 10.0.7 (Debian `1:10.0.7+ds-0+deb13u1+b1`) has a bug in
PPC64 emulation: `argv[1]` is always NULL on the initial process stack,
regardless of what arguments are passed. `argc` is correct and `argv[0]`,
`argv[2]`, etc. are fine -- only the second slot is zeroed. This causes any
program that reads command-line arguments to crash.

The kv binary itself is correct. CI uses GitHub Actions' QEMU which may or
may not have this bug. If PPC64 smoke tests fail in CI with a segfault,
this is the likely cause.

MIPS LE (`qemu-mipsel`) works correctly with the same QEMU version.

## Security

kv is designed for untrusted environments. See the security table below.

| Protection | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| Memory safety | Rust's type system prevents buffer overflows, use-after-free |
| JSON escaping | Control chars, quotes, backslashes properly escaped |
| Path traversal | Rejects `..` in devicetree paths |
| Input limits | Filter patterns truncated to 1024 chars |
| Recursion limits | Devicetree traversal stops at 64 levels |
| Safe parsing | Returns `None` on overflow instead of panicking |
| Read-only | Only reads from /sys and /proc, never writes |
| No shell | No command execution, no injection surface |
| No network | Pure local filesystem operations |
| Signed releases | Cosign keyless signatures via GitHub Actions OIDC |
